# ### Task given to student XY

# #### StackOverflow Comment:
# 
# We had a task given by our professor:
# 
# The task is to ask for an input from the user 
# (specifically the number of times the word will be printed out) 
# and then print out the word with repetitions according to the inputed number. 
# The code should use for-loop and a while-loop.
# 
# I am looking for a short and simple code.

# ##### For-Loop

# In[4]:


first_task = input('How many times would you like to output the word MNEMO?:')

for i in range(int(first_task)):
    print('MNEMO')


# ##### While-Loop

# In[8]:


second_task = int(input('How many times would you like to output the word MNEMO?'))

i = 0 

while i< second_task:
    
    print('MNEMO')
    i += 1
    
    


# ##### Of course I didn't post the solution but rather giving him/her tips on how to achieve this output.
